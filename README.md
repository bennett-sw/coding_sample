# Hi there! This repository contains the coding samples for Bennett Smith-Worthington. 
## It consists of 3 samples, one of which is in R markdown and two are .do files written in Stata:
### 1. 'TechCodingSample', which does some manipulation and aggregation of filenames using Python within Stata; it is more technical and uses more advanced techniques than a typical data task would require.
### 2. 'GraphCodingSample', which is a .do file that explores wealth inequality for various racial and educational groups; this falls in line with what a data task would typically require. The output (written in Latex) can be found in 'GraphCodingSampleOutput'.
### 3. 'Regressions_AJR2001' is a .Rmd file that tests the results of [Acemoglu, Johnson, and Robinson's (2001) seminal paper](https://pubs.aeaweb.org/doi/pdfplus/10.1257/aer.91.5.1369). The output is the file called 'Regressions_AJR2001.pdf', and the raw code is called 'Regressions_AJR2001.Rmd'
