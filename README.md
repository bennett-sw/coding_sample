# Hi there! This is the coding sample for Bennett Smith-Worthington. 
## It consists of two .do files written in Stata:
1. 'TechCodingSample', which does some manipulation and aggregation of filenames using Python within Stata; it is more technical and uses more advanced techniques than a typical data task would require.
2. 'GraphCodingSample', which is a .do file that explores inequality in wealth for various racial and educational groups; this falls in line with what a data task would typically require.

Please reach me at bs3248@columbia.edu with any questions!
