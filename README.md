# Hi there! This is the coding sample for Bennett Smith-Worthington. 
## It consists of two .do files written in Stata:
### 1. 'TechCodingSample', which does some manipulation and aggregation of filenames using Python within Stata; it is more technical and uses more advanced techniques than a typical data task would require.
### 2. 'GraphCodingSample', which is a .do file that explores wealth inequality for various racial and educational groups; this falls in line with what a data task would typically require. The output (written in Latex) can be found in 'GraphCodingSampleOutput'.

#### Please reach me at bs3248@columbia.edu with any questions!
